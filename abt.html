            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>We embrace a holistic and integrative approach to studying biological systems. By combining experimental techniques with computational modeling and data analysis, we strive to gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive biological processes. Our research spans multiple domains, including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and systems-level analysis.</p>
            <p>At the core of our approach is the recognition that biological systems are inherently complex and cannot be fully understood by studying individual components in isolation. Instead, we focus on the intricate networks of interactions between genes, proteins, metabolites, and other cellular components, and how these interactions collectively shape the behavior of the system as a whole.</p>
